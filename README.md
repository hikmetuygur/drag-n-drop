## Features

- The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`).
- The HTML file defines multiple empty containers and a fill element.
- The CSS file provides styling for the empty containers, the fill element, and various visual effects.
- The JavaScript file contains the necessary event listeners and functions to handle the drag and drop functionality.
- Users can drag the fill element by clicking and holding it.
- When the fill element is dragged over an empty container, the container's appearance changes to indicate it is a valid drop target.
- If the fill element is dropped onto an empty container, it is appended to that container.
- The project is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click and hold the fill element.
3. Drag the fill element over the empty containers.
4. When the desired empty container is highlighted, drop the fill element onto it.
5. The fill element will be appended to the selected empty container.

## Compatibility

The project is compatible with modern web browsers that support HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
